# 🎨 NFT Marketplace Project

Hi! 👋 I’m Aaditya rao, and this is my **NFT Marketplace** project.  
I built it as a way to explore **Web3 development** and learn how NFTs work in real life.  

## 📌 What it Does
- **Create NFTs** – You can mint NFTs for anything: photos, artwork, even things like degrees or certificates.
- **Buy & Sell NFTs** – Users can purchase NFTs and become the new owner.
- **Transfer Ownership** – Ownership is recorded securely on the blockchain.

Basically, it’s like OpenSea but super lightweight and built from scratch for learning.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Solidity** – For writing smart contracts
- **React.js** – Frontend UI
- **Ethers.js** – Connecting frontend with blockchain
- **IPFS** – For storing NFT images and metadata
- **Hardhat** – Development environment for Ethereum

## 💡 How it Works
1. Connect your wallet (MetaMask).
2. Create an NFT by uploading an image or file and giving it a name & description.
3. Mint the NFT → stored on IPFS + blockchain.
4. Other users can buy it, and the ownership transfers automatically.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/abhaysingh200/NFT-Marketplace.git

# Go into the project folder
cd NFT-Marketplace

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the frontend
npm start
